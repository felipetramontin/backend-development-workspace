# backend-development-workspace

Hi! My name is Felipe Tramontin and this repository serves the purpose of tracking my progress througout the Application Development I class.

## Overview

This repository is my personal backend development workspace for this course. It is used to organize projects, track learning progress, and practice professional Git and GitHub workflows. The repository will grow throughout the semester as I build backend applications, including a final REST API project.

## Learning Objectives

- Learn and apply Git and GitHub version control best practices

- Build and organize backend projects professionally

- Develop backend scripting and server-side logic skills

- Design and implement RESTful APIs

- Document technical work using Markdown

## How I Will Use This Repository

I will use this repository as a central hub to store backend projects, maintain notes and resources, and track my learning through consistent, meaningful commits. It will also serve as a professional showcase of my backend development workflow.
